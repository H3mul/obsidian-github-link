# GitHub Link

**Obsidian + GitHub ❤️**

Transform boring GitHub links in notes into badges with rich content from GitHub's API.

## Use

For public repositories, no extra configuration is required. For private repos, you'll need to log in through GitHub.

### Authentication

Authentication only requires a GitHub account. In GitHub Link plugin settings, add a new account. Give the account a name.

The plugin supports an automated authentication flow, or you can [generate your own token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). To use the automated flow, select "Generate Token". In the modal that appears, copy the code and open the authentication link. After pasting the auth link, you'll be prompted to allow access to the GitHub Link plugin. Once accepted, you can return to Obsidian and the token will be saved automatically.
