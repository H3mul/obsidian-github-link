			body: 'Hi @nathonius\n\nPer our [developer policies](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies),\nplease ensure that your plugin\'s name does not include the word "Obsidian".\nIn addition, the plugin name should not include the word "Plugin", as that is unecessary duplication.\nWe have already modified the name of your plugin to "Trello" in our records.\n\nTo maintain compliance, take the following actions:\n\n1. Modify the manifest.json file in your plugin repository.\n2. Generate a new release for your plugin to ensure users download the updated manifest.\n\nIf you have a idea for a different plugin name, you may also submit a pull request to the [obsidianmd/obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) repository.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\nâ€” the Obsidian team',

If this function returns True, the plugin will add the configured CSS classes to pages, or, if it returns a String or an array of Strings with CSS class names, will adds those. \r\n\r\nThis will allow having a more elaborate logic for marking pages with certain CSS classes. \r\n\r\n",

I was expecting that I'd be able to bind a trello card to a task in obsidian, but i think the model here is more one trello card <=> one obsidian page?\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like to be able to keep track of native tasks in obsidian and have it sync to trello , including archiving when the task is marked as finished. It's entirely possible my mental model is just wrong and I'm fighting the framework a bit.",

			body: 'Hi @OfficerHalf,\r\n\r\n**use case / Problem**\r\n- In v1 Obsidian using Inline Titles, the presence of a banner ([Banners Plugin](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners/)) usually covers the Inline Titles.\r\n- Therefore notes with a banner should have a [Banners Inline Title CSS snippet](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners/issues/76) automatically applied to adjust the inline title down.\r\n- However notes that have a banner don\'t universally share a unique file path or tag.\r\n- Can the "Banner Inline Title" CSS snippet be activated automatically by the Auto Class plugin in the presence of only the banner yaml? e.g. `banner: "https://picsum.photos/500"`\r\n\r\nthanks ',
